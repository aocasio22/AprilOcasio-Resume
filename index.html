        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is April Ocasio, I am currently enrolled at UCR as a Global Studies major.  I was born and raised in San Bernardino by my grandmother.  I am one of five children that I know of.  I went to Pacific High School in San Bernardino where I attained a 3.7 GPA by graduation with high honors.  I used to think that I wouldn't be able to graduate high school, but I worked hard and did well.  I currently have one pet, a chihuahua named Rascal, my best furry friend Pocket sadly passed away back in October.  I miss him so much and still think about him every day.  He inspires me to do better.  I worked at my school's cafeteria for two years, and after that I worked at Del Taco for a year before coming to Riverside.  I currently work at the dining hall on campus where I usually work as a cashier or counter up at the front, but lately I've been taking on custodial shifts to expand my knowledge of the types of jobs available to me while at the dining hall.  On my free time I like to hang out with my friends, we usually hang out in Pentland Hills, though sometimes we take trips to off campus places.  We've gone to Target a lot lately, as well as a few weeks ago we went to San Bernardino to find my friend's missing scooter that was presumably stolen, based on where the Air Tag showed.  I enjoy making Tik Toks with my friends that show just how our days go sometimes.  Recently I saw a Tik Tok where someone was in Big Bear and was sitting on a bear statue.  One of my friends lived in Big Bear for a while, so she told us where that statue was.  We went there very early in the morning and remade the Tik Tok.  I love to make friends with my coworkers so that we can film Tik Toks together too.  Some days are more exciting than others, but every day is a surprise to be sure.  I am going to school to one day become a lawyer to help people and families who need it by being a public defender.  I love to listen to music, especially while going on a walk during the evening. I like hip hop, rap, and indie music.  While I am not too athletically inclined, I played the trumpet for three years while I was in elementary and middle school.  My favorite places to get food are Raising Canes, Jack in the Box, and In n Out.  Whenever my friends and I go out, we always visit one of these places and have a great time doing it.  My favorite season is winter/fall because I like the cool air, it is a good vibe.  The colors and the holidays make me happy.  I dislike summer due to the heat, but I do like summer break and the fact that it is close to fall.  <br><br>
